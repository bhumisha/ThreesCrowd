# Three's A Crowd

We've created a game in where the object is to acquire three cards of either matching suit or matching value. The player can choose to view the rules in a modal pop up if they click on the "Rules" button in the header. When the "Play" button is clicked, the player is asked for their name which sets up score and name being stored in local storage.

# Tools

In order to create our MVP, we've put our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript to great us, with some JQuery thrown in where applicable. We've chosen Semantic UI as our CSS framework and after extensive research have implemented it throughout.
