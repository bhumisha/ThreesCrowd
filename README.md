# Three's A Crowd

We've created a game in where the player is to acquire three cards of either matching suit. The player can choose to view the rules in a modal pop up if they click on the "Rules" button in the header. When the "Play" button is clicked, the player is asked for their name which sets up score and name being stored in local storage.

# Tools

In order to create our MVP, we've put our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Jquery to great us. We've chosen Semantic UI as our CSS framework and after extensive research have implemented it throughout.

It is uploaded in GitHub.
